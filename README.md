# ML-Salary-Prediction-Model
ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly project demonstrates how to build a simple salary prediction model using Python and Machine Learning. It focuses on exploring the linear relationship between years of job experience and salary.

ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Salary generally increases with job experience. In this project, we use a dataset containing just two features:

YearsExperience

Salary

The goal is to predict the salary of a person based on their years of experience using Linear Regression.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

scikit-learn (for building the ML model)

ðŸš€ Project Workflow

Import Dataset
Read and explore the Salary_Data.csv file.

Data Preprocessing

Check for null values

Visualize the relationship between experience and salary

Model Building

Use LinearRegression from scikit-learn

Split data into training and testing sets

Prediction

Train the model

Predict salary based on user input (years of experience)

ðŸ“ˆ Results

The visualization shows a perfect linear correlation between job experience and salary.

The model effectively predicts salary for given experience values.

ðŸ”® Example Output
Years of Experience : 2
Predicted Salary =  [[44169.21]]
