# ML-Salary-Prediction-Model
# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly project demonstrates how to build a simple **salary prediction model** using **Python** and **Machine Learning**. It focuses on exploring the linear relationship between **years of job experience** and **salary**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Salary generally increases with job experience. In this project, we use a dataset containing just two features:

- `YearsExperience`
- `Salary`

The goal is to predict the salary of a person based on their years of experience using **Linear Regression**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- scikit-learn (for building the ML model)

---

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Import Dataset**  
   Load the dataset from `Salary_Data.csv`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Check for missing values  
   - Visualize the data using scatter plots with regression trendlines

3. **Model Building**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`

4. **Prediction**  
   - Predict salary based on user-inputted years of experience

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- The visualization shows a **strong linear correlation** between job experience and salary.
- The trained model accurately predicts salary based on years of experience.

---

## ðŸ”® Example Output

```bash
Years of Experience : 2
Predicted Salary =  [[44169.21]]
